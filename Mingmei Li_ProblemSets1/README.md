### Purpose
The purpose of this problem set was to understand how to use GitHub, Markdown, and compile a C program using CLI.

### Description
The Problem Set 1.1 covered how to use the Git version control system with GitHub. I had to learn the basic terminology, such as commit, pull, and push, used in Git/GitHub to understand how to version control software. The Problem Set 1.2 was about writing a read me. In it, we were required to use syntax such as `#`, `*`, and `--` to format the README.md file so that the file is formatted nicely on GitHub when it is displayed. 

### Build and Run Commands
The Problem Set 1.1 and 1.2 does not require any build and run commands. 
	
### Acknowledgement
I used the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) on GitHub to figure out the syntax for Markdown.
