### Files Included
- README.md

- Problemset2.2
- Problemset2.3

### Purpose
The purpose of this problem set was to understand printf(), display Variable Values (integer), and display Variable Values (float)

### Description
For problemset 2.2 and 2.3, I need to know how to define the datatypes, and how to use variables. I use the documentataion and the class presentation to wrote the problemset. For example, I should use int to define integer and use float to define the float number. I also need to use format specifiers for printf() with comma separated arguments to print out values.

### Build and Run Commands
To build the Problem Set 2.1 2.2 and 2.3, use 
	clang problemset2.1.c -o problemset2.1

To run the compiled `helloworld` program, use:

	./problemset2.1
