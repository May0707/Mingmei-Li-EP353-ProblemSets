#### What have you done for your project so far?

thought about the math: two delay buffers, one for each channel. The input of one stereo channel plus the feedback of the opposite channel's delay buffer should be be fed into each delay.
And I'm tying to implement that...

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

figure out how to implement the feedback and how to saparate channel

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Is my theory correct?
How can I spit the channels? and do 2 buffers?
