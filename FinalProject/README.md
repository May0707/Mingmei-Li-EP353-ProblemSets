# Final Project

The final project is an opportunity to take your newly acquired audio programming skills in C to develop your very own piece of audio software. So long as your project draws upon the course materials, the nature of your project is entirely up to you. Please remember that your project does need to get approved by the instructor. Your audio software may be a game, synthesizer, audio effect, or a math or science application, or anything else you choose. This is a wide-open project, and you are expected to be creative in your approach to it. Build something that interests you and something that you can take with outside of this course.

## Starter Ideas
Here are just some of the ideas for your final project:

- Use [PortAudio](http://www.portaudio.com/), [PortMIDI](http://portmedia.sourceforge.net/portmidi/), and [Soundpipe](https://paulbatchelor.github.io/proj/soundpipe.html) to create a synthesizer.
- Create an audio editor using [libsndfile](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/), [FLTK](https://www.fltk.org/), and [PortAudio](http://www.portaudio.com/).
- Use [PortAudio](http://www.portaudio.com/), [fftw](http://fftw.org/), and [FLTK](https://www.fltk.org/) to visualize audio in real-time.
- Develop an audio streaming program using [ROC](https://roc-project.github.io/).
- Build a CLI program using C.
- Integrate C program with Csound.
- Write an algorithmic synthesis and music program.
- Write a music application for a microcontroller.

## Schedule

Extensions on the final project are not ordinarily granted, except in cases of emergency.

### Preproposal

*due by April 1, 9:00 am*

Preproposal is intended to promote early thought. This is your opportunity to bounce one or more ideas off of your friends. 

Create a new folder named `FinalProject` in your GitHub repository for problem sets. Create another folder within the `FinalProject` named `Preproposal`. Inside the `Preproposal`, create `README.md` file and answer the questions in [Preproposal/README.md](./Preproposal/README.md). Commit and push your preproposal before the deadline.

### Proposal

*due by April 8, 9:00 am*

The proposal is your opportunity to receive approval and counsel from your instructor before you proceed to design. Your instructor will either approve your proposal or require modifications for subsequent approval. Your proposal, even if approved, is not binding. You may alter your plan at any point, provided you obtain your instructor's consent for any modifications. You would need to resubmit your proposal if you made changes to your final project. **IMPORTANT:** Projects submitted without approval will not receive credit. Please communicate with the instructor if you plan to change your project. 

In the `FinalProject` folder in your GitHub repository, create another folder named `Proposal`. Inside the `Proposal`, create `README.md` file and answer the questions in [Proposal/README.md](./Proposal/README.md). Commit and push your proposal before the deadline.

### Status Report

*due by April 29, 9:00 am*

Not only is the status report intended to keep the instructor apprised of your progress, but it is also an opportunity to keep yourself on track. 

In the `FinalProject` folder in your GitHub repository, create another folder named `StatusReport`. Inside the `StatusReport `, create `README.md` file and answer the questions in [Status/README.md](./Status/README.md). Commit and push your status report before the deadline.

### Final Implementation

*due by May 6, 9:00 am**  
**No late submission is accepted, except in cases of emergency.*

You must submit your software implementation and documentation of your final project via GitHub in the `FinalProject` folder. Your submission thereof must include all of the below:

1. Documentation for your project in the form of `README.md` (You must name this `README.md`). This documentation is to be a user's manual for your project. Though the structure of your documentation is entirely up to you, it should be incredibly clear to the instructor how and where, if applicable, to compile, configure, and use your project. Your documentation should be at least several paragraphs in length. It should not be necessary for the instructor to contact you with questions regarding your project after its submission. Hold our hand with this documentation; be sure to answer in your documentation any questions that you think someone might have while testing your work.

2. A "design document" for your project in the form of a Markdown file called `DESIGN.md` that discusses, technically, how you implemented your project and why you made the design decisions you did. Your design document should be at least several paragraphs in length. Whereas your documentation is meant to be a user's manual, consider your design document your opportunity to give the instructor a technical tour of your project underneath its hood.

3. All files required to run your software, including source code as well as, if applicable, configuration files, Makefiles, sample inputs, audio files, etc. All source code should be thoroughly commented.

4. A presentation file in the form of PowerPoint (.ppt) or Keynote (.key). Your presentation should have your name, project title, and details that you'd like to convey to your fellow classmates. A PDF file named [PresentationGuideline.pdf](./PresentationGuideline/PresentationGuideline.pdf) is included as a guide for you to prepare your presentation. 

As the fourth point suggests, you will be presenting your final project during the last week of the semester. You will be required to demo your software during your 10 minutes presentation. If you are afraid that the live demo may not work during your presentation, you may want to consider videotaping your software in action before the last week of the semester and include it in your presentation.

## Academic Honesty
You will be expected to attribute due credit to the originator of any ideas, words, programming code, or other ideas that you incorporate into your own work. In computer programming, it's common to use program components written by others that are known to be reliable, written by others. A lot of good (and some bad) program code is freely available. Nevertheless, one must always give full attribution to the original author of all program code.
