# Proposal

### What will (likely) be the title of your project?

ping-pang delay

### In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A real-time FM Synthesizer with MIDI control.")

ping-pang audio delay effect

### In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

it's aduio delay fx but it can go through two speakers with control. It will have these parameters: 1, mix: dry/wet. 2, echo time 3,feedback 4,single echo mode or pingpang mode 
I hope it can be the VST or AU plug-in format that we can directly use in a daw. 

### In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

#### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

the delay with only pingpang effect but no chtrol with other parameter. Not in VST or AU effect, just C code file.

#### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

the delay with pingpang effect, dry/wet, echo time parameter. In VST and AU plug-in format.

#### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?


the delay effect with all the parameter above. And it can run with a DAW successfully. 

### In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

1. How to transfer a C code file to a VST or AU plug-in format.
2.  How to implement my feature in code
3.  Do some interface design
