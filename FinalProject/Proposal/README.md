### What will (likely) be the title of your project?

ping-pang delay

### In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A real-time FM Synthesizer with MIDI control.")

### In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

it's aduio delay fx but it can go through two speakers with control

### In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

#### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

the delay effect

#### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

the delay effect with stereo

#### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
